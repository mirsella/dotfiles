- **Preserve Existing Behavior**: Do not modify, refactor, or "improve" existing logic unless explicitly instructed to do so. Your primary role is to assist with specific, targeted tasks.

- **Follow Existing Code Style**: Match the formatting, naming conventions, and module structure of the surrounding code.

- Never use `git` command that will modify something, unless explicitly allowed. only use read only commands like log, diff. dont commit anything, dont push anything.

- Never use `just`.

- never run `cargo run`.

- never run `cargo clean` or delete cache.

- Never change the database, deploy anything, or migrate anything. you can only change code.

- When you need to search docs, use `deepwiki` tools.
